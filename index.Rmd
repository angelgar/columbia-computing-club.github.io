<h1 style="text-align:center">Welcome to the Columbia Biostatistics Computing Club!</h1>

<p>

<img src="images/columbia_biostatistics.png" style="width:50%" align="left" hspace="20"> The Columbia Biostatistics Computing Club hosts casual seminars focusing on computational topics often encountered in biostatistics research. These tutorials provide hands-on learning at a variety of skill levels, with some focused on bringing new students up to speed and others addressing more advanced problems. Our overarching goal is to impart good programming practices that encourage collaborative reproducible research!

This year's organizers are [Charly Fowler](https://www.charlottefowler.com/), [Amy Pitts](https://amypitts01.github.io/), Safiya Sirota, Ziyi Wang, Guadalupe Antonio Lopez, and Gustavo Garcia-Franceschini. In the doctoral program, Charly is in her fifth year, Amy is in her fourth year, while Ziyi and Safiya are both in their third year, and Guadalupe and Gustavo are starting their first year. The group is run with the help of faculty advisor [Christine Mauro](http://christinemauro.com/). A schedule for the upcoming  events is below and will be regularly updated. Please fill out this [survey](
